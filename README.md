**Translate Mathematical Jargon from Sinhala/Singlish to English**  
*Tailored for Sri Lankan GCE A/L Terminology*

This resource is specifically designed to assist English-medium students in translating mathematical terms from Sinhala or Singlish (transliterated sinhala) to English. With a shortage of quality English-medium mathematics instruction, I aim to bridge the language gap and support students in their studies.

**Why Use This Resource?**  
- **Sri Lankan GCE A/L Focus:** Aligned with the curriculum to cater to the needs of students preparing for the Sri Lankan GCE Advanced Level examinations.
- **Accessible Translation:** Easily translate Sinhala mathematical terms into English, enhancing comprehension and learning.
- **Supporting English-Medium Students:** Designed to aid English-medium students in understanding and navigating mathematical concepts commonly presented in Sinhala.

**A Call for Exploration:**  
While this resource serves as a valuable tool, I also encourage students to consider exploring Sinhala medium classes, such as those led by esteemed educators like Ajantha Dissanayake Sir, to further enrich their mathematical understanding.
